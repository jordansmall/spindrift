## The `spindrift` CLI

`nix develop` (or `direnv allow`) puts a single `spindrift` binary on your PATH
— it is the primary surface, and everything runs through it:

| command                          | what it does                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spindrift dispatch`             | fan out one container per `ready-for-agent` issue, in dependency waves          |
| `spindrift dispatch 42 57`       | dispatch exactly these issues, bypassing the label/barrier gates                |
| `spindrift dispatch --no-build`  | fail fast if the image is absent instead of building it first (split build/run) |
| `spindrift dispatch --yes`       | skip the confirmation prompt when dispatching unlabeled issues (alias `--force`)|
| `spindrift preview [issue...]`   | dry run: show what `dispatch` would pick up, and the wave ordering               |
| `spindrift build`                | realise/load the agent image (or store closures) without running any agent      |
| `spindrift recover <issue>`      | re-run the merge gate for one issue (adopt a stranded `agent-in-progress`)       |
| `spindrift doctor`               | check forge credentials, repository connectivity, and triage label presence; when run interactively (TTY attached) and labels are missing it offers to create them with default colors and descriptions; in CI (no TTY) it reports the missing labels and exits non-zero without prompting |
| `spindrift --help`               | concise usage: subcommands, common flags, and pointers to the full reference    |
| `spindrift --help --all`         | the full flag reference, grouped by category (same content as `man spindrift`)  |
| `man spindrift`                  | the manual page (installed alongside the binary on your PATH)                    |
| `spindrift --version`            | installed version and revision                                                  |

Every runtime knob is also a `--flag`, with **flag > env > default** precedence.
`spindrift --help` stays scannable; the full generated table lives in
`man spindrift` (and `spindrift --help --all` for the same thing in the
terminal). Bare `spindrift` with no subcommand is `spindrift dispatch`.

> **Deprecated (removed in v0.2.0, see [`MIGRATING.md`](../MIGRATING.md)):**
> `nix run .#run` and `nix run .#build` still work but print a notice and forward
> to `spindrift dispatch` / `spindrift build`. `spindrift engage <issue>` is a
> deprecated alias for `spindrift recover <issue>`.

If you use **direnv**, the template's `.envrc` (`use flake`) activates the dev
shell automatically on `cd` — no manual `nix develop` needed.

`spindrift build` **realises** the image derivation and then loads it into your
container runtime. On a host with a Linux builder (any Linux machine, or a Mac
with a Linux builder configured) it realises the image directly. On a stock Mac
— no Linux builder — it transparently falls back to building the image inside an
**ephemeral Nix container** on the same runtime it already requires, keeping a
named `/nix` volume so rebuilds stay incremental. Either way the result is
`spindrift:latest`, loaded and ready for `spindrift dispatch`. If the host has
neither a Linux builder nor a container runtime, `spindrift build` exits with
instructions.
